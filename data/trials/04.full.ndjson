Participants with solid tumors will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype, will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified, will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever occurs first.","conditiions":"Solid Tumors","type":"Interventional","phase":"Phase 2","arm":[{"cohortlabel":"Cohort A: ROS1 fusion-positive tumors","drug":"Entrectinib","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"ROS1 fusion","gene":"ROS1","type":"fusion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort B: NTRK1/2/3","drug":"Entrectinib","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"NTRK1 fus","gene":"NTRK1","type":"fusion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"},{"summary":"NTRK2 fus","gene":"NTRK2","type":"fusion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"},{"summary":"NTRK3 fus","gene":"NTRK3","type":"fusion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort C: ALK fusion-positive tumors","drug":"Alectinib","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"ALK fusion","gene":"ALK","type":"fusion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort D: TMB-high tumors","drug":"Atezolizumab","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"TMB high","gene":"","type":"TMB","variant":"","function":"high","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort E: AKT1/2/3 mutant-positive tumors","drug":"Ipatasertib","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"AKT1 mut","gene":"AKT1","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"},{"summary":"AKT2 mut","gene":"AKT2","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"},{"summary":"AKT3 mut","gene":"AKT3","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort F: HER2 mutant-positive tumors","drug":"Trastuzumab emtansine","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"HER2 mut","gene":"HER2","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort G: MDM2-amplified, TP53 wild-type tumors","drug":"Idasanutlin","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"MDM2 amp","gene":"MDM2","type":"amplification","variant":"","function":"","selection":"include"},{"summary":"TP53 mut WT","gene":"TP53","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"","selection":"exclude"},{"summary":"TP53 del WT","gene":"TP53","type":"deletion","variant":"","function":"","selection":"exclude"},{"summary":"TP53 amp WT","gene":"TP53","type":"amplification","variant":"","function":"","selection":"exclude"}]},{"cohortlabel":"Cohort H: PIK3CA multiple mutant-positive tumors","drug":"GDC-0077","arm_type":"Experimental","line_of_therapy":"","arm_hold_status":"","biomarker":[{"summary":"PIK3CA mut multiple","gene":"PIK3CA","type":"mutation","variant":"","function":"multiple","selection":"include"}]}],"docs":"","min_age":{},"criteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced and unresectable or metastatic solid malignancy\nMeasurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, or International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC)\nPerformance status as follows: Participantss aged >= 18 years: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2;
