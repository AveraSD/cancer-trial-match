Of note, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will not count as prior lines of therapy.\nHistologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC defined as ER and progesterone receptor staining <10%, and HER2 negative defined as IHC 0 to 1+\nDocumented Notch activation from tumor biopsy results from within the last 2 years from a commercially available NGS assay, LDT or other validated IUO clinical trial assay.\nWomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment that is considered medically active and may interfere in the ability to detect responses in this subject. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\nBC that, in the opinion of the investigator, is considered amenable to potentially curative treatment.\nSymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\nCurrent or recent (within 2 months of IP administration) gastrointestinal (GI) disease or disorders that increase the risk of diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease.\nDeveloped immune-mediated colitis with immunotherapy unless resolved to G1 or lower and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of IP.\nPeripheral neuropathy Grade 2 for at least 14 days prior to first dose of IP.\nEvidence of uncontrolled, active infection, requiring systemic anti-bacterial, anti-viral or anti-fungal therapy ≤7 days prior to administration of IP such as known active infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nUnstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary function or uncontrolled diabetes) or any important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would, in the investigator's judgment, increase the risk to the subject associated with his or her participation in the study.\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥2.\n\nAbnormal organ and marrow function defined as:\n\nneutrophils <1000/mm3,\nplatelet count <75,000/mm3,\nhemoglobin <8 g/dL,\ntotal bilirubin >1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) (except known Gilbert's syndrome whereby the total bilirubin must be < 5 mg/dL),\naspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2.5 ULN OR >5 ULN for subjects with liver metastases,\ncreatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min (calculation of CrCl will be based on acceptable institution standard),\nuncontrolled triglyceride ≥Grade 2 elevations per CTCAE v5.0 (>300 mg/dL or >3.42 mmol/L).\nMyocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.\nMean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥480 msec.\nCompleted palliative radiation therapy < 7 days prior to initiating IP.\nPrior treatment with gamma secretase inhibitors.\nLast chemotherapy, biologic, or investigational therapy agent at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to initiating IP; at least 6 weeks if the last regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C. Prior treatment with investigational monoclonal antibody will be reviewed case-by-case by the Sponsor.\nReceiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of IP. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.\nUse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 within 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer).\nLife expectancy is less than 3 months.","gender":"All","link":"<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04461600\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04461600<\/a>"}]}
